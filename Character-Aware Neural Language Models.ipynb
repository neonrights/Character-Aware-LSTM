    "This notebook will describe a \"Character-Aware Neural Language Model\". At its simplest level, it is an amalgamation of a convolutional neural network, a highway network, and a long short term memory recurrent neural network. The CNN takes the characters of a given word as input, then combines its output with a highway network which is then fed into the LSTM. The LSTM then produces a word-level prediction. The model is trained on the Penn Treebank, as sample of which is imported below."
