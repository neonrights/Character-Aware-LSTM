    "This notebook will describe a \"Character-Aware Neural Language Model\". At its simplest level, it is an amalgamation of a convolutional neural network, a highway network, and a long short term memory recurrent neural network. The CNN takes the characters of a given word as input, then combines its output with a highway network which is then fed into the LSTM. The LSTM then produces a word-level prediction. The model is trained on the Penn Treebank, as sample of which is imported below. A representation of the model's architecture can be viewed in <b>Figure 1</b>."

    "As we can see from <b>Figure 1</b>, the base layers is a convolutional neural network. The cNN takes the characters in a word as input, this can be reprented as a vector $\\mathbf{w}_k$, the $k$-th word in a sequence, with character $c_{kj}$, the id of the $j$-th character in word $k$. Since each word has variable length, each word is padded to a uniform length equal to the length of the longest word. Each word also has a start and end character prepended and appended to it before padding, which aids accuracy of the model. Additionally each sequence is padded to a length of 35, since the LSTM is trained using truncated backpropagation up to 35 time-steps. This is discuseed in more detail later. Both of these changes are to increase ease during batch training."
