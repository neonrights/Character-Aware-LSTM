    "This notebook will describe and implement a word prediction model proposed in the paper <i>Character-Aware Neural Language Models</i> by Yoon Kim et al. At its simplest level, it is an amalgamation of a convolutional neural network, a highway network, and a long short term memory recurrent neural network. The CNN takes the characters of a given word as input, then combines its output with a highway network which is then fed into the LSTM. The LSTM then produces a word-level prediction. The model is trained on the Penn Treebank, as sample of which is imported below. A representation of the model's architecture can be viewed in <b>Figure 1</b>."

    "As we can see from <b>Figure 1</b>, the base layers is a convolutional neural network. The cNN takes the characters in a word as input, this can be reprented as a vector $\\mathbf{w}_k$, the $k$-th word in a sequence, with character $c_{kj}$, the id of the $j$-th character in word $k$. Since each word has variable length, each word is padded to a uniform length equal to the length of the longest word. Each word also has a start and end character prepended and appended to it before padding, which aids accuracy of the model. Additionally each sequence taken to have a length of 35, since the LSTM is trained using truncated backpropagation up to 35 time-steps. This is discuseed in more detail later. Both of these changes are to increase ease during batch training."

For comparison, here is the performance of the same test set on the trained model with the best validation set."

    "A character-aware neural network is a very novel idea and seems to perform well in making character to word predictions. Personally, I had difficulty training the model successfully according to the method outlined by Kim et al. A cursory glance at the computed validation perplexity compared to the training perplexity seems to imply that the model is overfitting its parameters. Assuming the model is sound, that would in turn imply that a dropout with a rate of 0.5 is not sufficient regularization. A good followup to this character to word model would be to design and train a character to chararacter model since the current model has a fixed size vocabulary."
